**WARNING: THIS IS NOT EVEN CLOSE TO BEING FINISHED!**

Downsample 3D cartesian grids using FFTW.

Natively handles gbpTrees and VELOCIraptor files.


TODO
----

- [X] Malloc orig using FFTW (with inplace padding)
- [X] Do an inplace FFT
- [ ] Convolution
- [ ] Inverse FFTW
- [ ] Reshuffle data inplace
- [ ] Write the data back out
- [ ] Get rid of choice of grid and convert all grids
- [ ] Do an implementation for VELOCIraptor
