**WARNING: THIS IS NOT EVEN CLOSE TO BEING FINISHED!**

Downsample 3D cartesian grids using FFTW.

Natively handles gbpTrees and VELOCIraptor files.

- [X] Inverse FFTW
- [X] Reshuffle data inplace
- [X] Write the data back out
- [X] Get rid of choice of grid and convert all grids
- [ ] Documentation
- [ ] Tests
- [ ] Do an implementation for VELOCIraptor
